# Learn

## Adaptation over memorization

Learn so you can use your knowledge for new situations.

- adaptation is more important than memorization
- adaptative, flexible knowledge helps solving new problems, facing new challenges
- memorization is important, but isn't the most important
- to only memorize leads to rigid knowledge
- instead, make your brain **available** for approaching, investigating new challenges
- some fields change fast (e.g. programming): memorization would be wasting time, where tools and mindset save your time

## Guidelines

Be conscious of:
- your learning habits (to change/improve them)
- your state of mind (to manage your emotions)
- your work environment
- your time management habits
- your wins and losses

## Helpers & obstacles

It's easier to learn when:
- you love what you learn (know yourself)
- you feel confident about it (manage your emotions)
- you can share/teach it (join/create a community)
- you agree with the teacher/material (use critical thinking)
