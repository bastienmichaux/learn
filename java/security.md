# Java

## Security

Java removed security holes from its design, so its theoretically secure.
- Bytecode has restrictions eliminating some problems: it doesn't directly address memory.
- Untrusted classes go through **bytecode verification**.

Most security flaws in Java are found in the implementation of the security architecture.
